The syntax of a .st file is as follows :
an example :

" Copyright (C) 2021 Zara.
  See the LICENSE file for details 
"

Object subclass: #Solstice
	instance:''
        class: ''
#

new
	| |

#
mainloop
	| |

#

Everything between "" are comments.
There is a '#' after each method, instance: contains the instance variable
names and class: the class variable names.

The derived Object has a '#' before it, so #Solstice and a '#' after the 
class definition.

End of File ends parsing for this class. TODO : class methods.
